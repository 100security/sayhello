# 📸 SayHello - Camera Capture via Social Engineering over HTTPS

**SayHello** is an enhanced version of the well-known project  [SayCheese](https://github.com/hangetzzu/saycheese), a tool designed to capture images from victims' cameras through social engineering. Building upon this concept, SayHello improves stability, simplifies execution, and integrates natively with the official **Ngrok API **, eliminating the need for manual tunnel configuration.
